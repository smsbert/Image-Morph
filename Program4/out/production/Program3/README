PROJECT: Program 4
AUTHORS: Angelina Grosso and Sarah Sbert

To run the program run GridControlPoints.

Menu Bar:
    Quit: exits the program
    Options:
        File:
            Open preimage: opens the start image
            Open postimage: opens the end image
        Setup: opens a popup that allows the user to control the number of control points,
               allows the user to control the number of frames per second and the number of seconds to complete the morph.
               There is also a done button which will close the popup.
        Reset: will reset the control points to their original positions and the images to their original brightness
        Morph Options:
               opens a popup showing the left grid. There are three buttons, morph, preview morph and done.
               Morph shows the full image morphing from the start image to the end image
               Preview Morph shows the morph of the control points from the left grid to the right grid
               Done will close the popup.


Grids: each rectangle is a control point. The left grid is the initial and contains the start image
       and the right grid is the final and contains the end image.
       When you click on a control point you can drag it anywhere you want within the drag constraint so no point can move
       to create overlapping triangles.
       You can move control points on either grid and the corresponding point on the opposite grid will turn red.

Start Image Brightness:
        The "+" will brighten the intensity of the start image
        The "-" will dim the intensity of the start image

End Image Brightness:
        The "+" will brighten the intensity of the end image
        The "-" will dim the intensity of the end image
